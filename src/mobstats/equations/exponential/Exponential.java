/**
 * Represents a StatSolver that uses exponential equations to solve for it.
 * 
 * An exponential equation is an equation with a constant that is put to the power of the x value then multiplied by another constant and added by one more constant. It requires logarithms to solve for the root.
 * b is sent to the power of x minus d times c then multiplied by a and then has f added on.
